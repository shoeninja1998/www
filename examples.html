<h1>Astartes</h1>
<h2>Syama Pedersen</h2> 
    <p>
        This is a fanmade animated series based on the world of Warhammer 40k.
        Acclaimed for its masterful use of 3d animation, Pedersen's work has
        become part of the official Warhammer 40k website. His use of Staging
        engages the audience in a fun, unique way.
        <br><br>
        Pedersen frames his scenes with concision in mind. Most of the time,
        the only visible object in a shot is the focal point. This efficiently
        communicates to the audience what is important.

<h1>A Brief Disagreement</h1>
<h2>Author here</h2>
    <p>
        This satirical animation can be only described as chaos. What starts
        as a "brief" disagreement rapidly involves into warfare across the eras.
        The use of solid drawing is very evident in this work; the audience is constantly
        shown different perspectives of one figure, almost as if the video was taken
        from a single recording of a flying camera.

            Animated Works
        </h3>
            <p>
                The following are animated works done by talented individuals and
                teams. I'll be using these works to showcase different principles,
                explaining how they improve the medium.

            <h1>Diamond Jack</h1>
            <h2>Rachel Kim</h2>
                <p>
                    A digitally-made animation drawn solely by Rachel Kim,
                    this video hit over 35 million view on Youtube. <br>
                    This work is oozing with appeal. The characters are 
                    charming, with big eyes & defining colors.
                    <br><br>
                    The playful attitude from the protagonist as the focal
                    point of the appeal. His smiling makes his robbery feel
                    like a fun game, inviting the police to come along.

            <h1>Astartes</h1>
            <h2>Syama Pedersen</h2> 
                <p>
                    This is a fanmade animated series based on the world of Warhammer 40k.
                    Acclaimed for its masterful use of 3d animation, Pedersen's work has
                    become part of the official Warhammer 40k website. His use of Staging
                    engages the audience in a fun, unique way.
                    <br><br>
                    Pedersen frames his scenes with concision in mind. Most of the time,
                    the only visible object in a shot is the focal point. This efficiently
                    communicates to the audience what is important.

            <h1>A Brief Disagreement</h1>
            <h2>Steve Cutts</h2>
                <p>
                    This satirical animation can be only described as chaos. What starts
                    as a "brief" disagreement rapidly involves into warfare across the eras.
                    The use of solid drawing is very evident in this work; the audience is constantly
                    shown different perspectives of one figure, almost as if the video was taken
                    from a single recording of a flying camera.

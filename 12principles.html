<body class="principles">
#1: Squash & Stretch<br>
All shapes are distorted in some way when affected by an outside force. Even if we don’t notice, we see this every day in our lives. In Animation, Squash & Stretch is the principal of imitating and exaggerating this effect.
<br><br>
For example, imagine a rubber ball slamming onto a concrete floor. When the ball makes contact, it squishes, growing shorter and wider simultaneously.
<br>
#2: Anticipation<br>
Imagine a spring. When you hold it down, can you tell that releasing the spring will make it explode outward? In other words, you’re anticipating the spring to ‘spring’ forward.
<br>
Anticipation is the preparation for the main action. Squeezing the spring down is the ‘anticipation’, and the release of the spring would be the main action.
<br><br>
#3: Staging<br>
Staging is the process of combining the many elements in a scene: Where are your characters? What are they going to do? What angle will the camera be at?
<br>
Doing this step well is crucial to effectively communicating a story to an audience;  Your placement of elements dictates what people will pay attention to.
<br><br>
#4: Straight Ahead Action and Pose-to-Pose<br>
These are the two different ways you can draw animation: You can draw each frame in order, known as Straight Ahead Action. You could also draw the extreme poses in a character’s movement first, then fill in the betweens. This is known as Pose-to-Pose.
<br><br>
#5: Follow Through and Overlapping Action<br>
When something moving comes to a stop, any loose parts of it may continue to move. For example, imagine a person with long hair on a roller coaster. When the roller coaster comes to a stop, their hair flings forward, right? This is what’s known as Follow Through in animation. The loose parts of an object are following through the primary object, overlapping its action.
<br><br>
#6: Ease In, Ease Out<br>
In physics, this would be known as acceleration and deceleration. Gradually speeding up is the ‘Ease-In’ and slowing down is the ‘Ease-Out’. Incorporating this gradual moving adds a lifelike quality to any animation.
<br><br>
#7: Arcs<br>
Most living things don’t move in straight lines. Rather, they move in curved paths known in animation as arcs. If your goal is to imitate life in your art, make sure your movements mimic these curves.
<br><br>
#8: Secondary Action<br>
These are movements that support the main action of a scene. This can add dimension to a character, giving the audience more insight into what they may be thinking.
<br><br>
#9: Timing<br>
Sounds pretty self-explanatory, right? “Make the timing well” is easier said than done; there’s a lot of things to account for! In animation
<br><br>
#10: Exaggeration<br>
Exaggeration is presenting a character’s features or actions in an extreme form. This is normally done to create a comedic or dramatic effect. Using exaggeration can convey information much more effectively. For example, which person do you think is angrier?
<br><br>
#11: Solid Drawing<br>
Achieving a solid drawing means making animated things feel like they’re in a 3-dimensional space.
<br><br>
#12: Appeal<br>
People remember characters that are engaging, real, and interesting. Adding appeal to characters in their design & actions helps them achieve this status. A good way to appeal to all people is by making characters attractive.
